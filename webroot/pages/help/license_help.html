<h2 class="topictitle1">License</h2>
The first time you install IBM Upward Integration for VMware vSphere, you automatically receive a 90-day license trial period, beginning with the day it is installed. When the end of the 90-day period occurs, the tool will navigate to the trial license expiration page. If you want to continue to have full product functionality, you need to purchase a license otherwise functionality will become limited.
<h3 class="topictitle1">Trial version</h3>
The trial license expires after 90 days. In order to continue to have full product functionality, you need to purchase an official license.
<h3 class="topictitle1">Official version</h3>
After the 90-day trial period expires, you need to purchase an official license to have full product functionality. Please contact an IBM Representative or visit the License Help site.

<h1 class="topictitle1">Working with Predictive Failures</h1>
<div>
<p>
The Predictive Failure page allows you to view the Predictive Failures alert records and rules actions history, set a management policy against the server based on a hardware predictive failure alert. IBM VMWare plugin evacuates VMs from the server or notifies you based on defined policy. You can view predictive failure alerts from the server and the triggered policy history on this page.
<br/><br/><b>Note: </b>IBM VMWare plugin cannot receive predictive failure alerts from the server until you install the IBM CIM providers and enable host monitoring on the Power Metric page.

<h2 class="topictitle1">Policy and Rules Management</h2>
Policy Management defines a condition and the action that will be executed on the specified server cluster. you can create, edit and delete the custom migration policy.
<br />
Conditions include variant hardware PFA indications that IBM VMWare plugin receive from IMM. you can select them to form your rule.
<br />
An action occurs when the conditions has been triggered on the managed endpoint, and which actions will be managed by the server. You can define the 'migration' and 'notify' actions. 
<ul>
<li>The migration action automatically launches the pre-defined migration policy on the VCenter Server (See the VCenter Server User's Guide for more information)</li>
<li>The notify action displays a message log</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="topictitle1">Viewing Predictive Failure Events</h2>
The indication provider monitors Predictive Failure Alerts(PFAs) from IMM and send to IBM VMWare plugin. All of indication alters will be shown on the Event log table.
<h2 class="topictitle1">Viewing Action History</h2>
When the conditions of a rule are met, the defined action of the rule is launched on the managed endpoint. You can see all triggered rules and action results in the Action History table.
<br/><br/><b>Note:</b> A Notify action record has no status information, this record just indicts this action was successfully triggered.

<div>
<p>
The Dashboard gives you an overview of the host status. It includes the following summaries: 
<ul>
<li>A System Summary</li>
<li>A System Health Summary</li>
</ul>
The System Information Summary contains the information of the managed host. It lists the manufacturer, model, serial number, operating system, operating system version, and last boot information of the host.
The System Health Summary contains an overview of the system running status (the health messages from the host). All the messages are grouped into the following three categories by severity. 
<ul>
<li>Critical events are events that can or already have caused a host failure that requires your immediate attention. </li>
<li>Attention events are events that indicate that there is something abnormal on the host but the abnormality will not cause immediate failure of the host. </li>
<li>Information Events are events that indicate that something happened on the host that will not inhibit the host running.</li>
</ul>
Each of the System Health Summary categories is grouped in an expendable accordion box. The title indicates how many events are in the category, since the events are effective for a limited period, a maximum of 20 events are shown in each category. If you click on the title, the box extends and lists the following information details: 
<ul>
<li>Message </li>
<li>Event time</li>
<li>MessageID</li>
</ul>

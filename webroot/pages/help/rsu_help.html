		<p>
			Rolling System Update (RSU) provides a task manager that helps you manage rolling update tasks. A task contains all of the information and options for a rolling update.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Task Manager has the following task options:
			<ul>
				<li>Create a task</li>
				<li>Edit a task that has not been started</li>
				<li>Delete a task</li>
				<li>Cancel a running task</li>
				<li>Rerun a failed task</li>
				<li>Clone a completed task</li>
				<li>View reports of tasks</li>
			</ul>

				<li>
					Select a host to view available firmware from the right and choose the updates you want to apply.

						If inventory information has not been collected for a host, RSU displays firmware of its machine type for this host. In this case, you can still select firmware for this host to update.

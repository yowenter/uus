<h1 class="topictitle1">Working with Power and Cooling</h1>
<p>The topics in this section describe Power Metric options and provide you with the
ability to manage power usage using power capping and power throttling. </p>

<div>
	
	<h2>Power Metric page</h2>
  <p>
  	The Power Metric page has options for viewing the Power Usage
History, Thermal History, and Fan Summary. If the host is being monitored,
the current power usage, thermal history, fan history, and the time
of the monitor reading are displayed. This information is automatically
refreshed every five minutes. This information is helpful for determining
whether to reassign the workload.</p>	

	<h3>Enabling and disabling power monitoring</h3>
	<p>This topic provides a description of how to enable and disable power monitoring.</p>
	<div>
		<p>This topic provides a description of how to enable and disable power monitoring.</p>
    <h4>Procedure</h4>
    <ol>
    	<li>Select the <b>Power and Cooling</b> tab</li>
      <li>Click <b>Enable</b> to enable Power Monitor on a host. The Enable button is visible when Power Metric is not enabled on a host.</li>
      <li>In the credentials dialog box, enter the credentials for
the host and click <b>OK</b>. The host credentials will be saved in a database and the monitoring of
power usage begins.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Disable</b> to disable the monitoring.
        <p>Enable <b>Commands</b> on the USB Interface in uEFI by changing the uEFI settings before OS booting.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Setting Power Capping</h3>
  <p>Power capping allows
you to allocate less power and cooling to a system  if the firmware
supports capping and it is enabled. This feature can help lower datacenter
infrastructure costs and potentially allow more servers to be put
into an existing infrastructure. Setting a power capping value ensures
that system power consumption stays at or below the value defined
by the setting. The power cap value is the value you set for a rack
or blade server that will be capped by the firmware. The power cap
value is persistent across power cycles for both rack and blade servers.</p>

	<h3>Setting Power Throttling</h3>
  <p>Setting power throttling allows you to receive alerts when
power consumption exceeds a value you have set. You can set two power
throttling values individually, one for a warning and one for a critical
alert. When the power consumption exceeds a defined power throttling
value, IVP receives a throttling event, which is then displayed in
the Power Throttling Indications table.</p>
	<p>Enable Power Throttling before setting Power Throttling.</p>


	<h2>Viewing Power Usage History, Thermal Usage History, and Fan Usage History</h2>
  <p>The Power History, Thermal History, and Fan History charts are displayed on the right
pane of the page. You can customize the duration and intervals for
each of these charts.</p>
  <div>
  	<h3>Procedure</h3>
  	<ol>
  		<li>Select the <i>Power and Cooling</i> tab. For each of the history charts, you can:
  			<ul>
	  			<li>Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out of the charts, and use drag and drop to move a chart.</li>
	        <li>Click <b>Set Duration</b> to change the collection of history data to a different time interval.</li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
       	Select one of the following options from the left pane.
       	<dl>
       		<dt><b>General</b></dt>
         	<dd>On this page, you can set the value of each power metric attribute after enabling power monitoring on a host.</dd>

        <dl>
        	<dt><b>Power History</b></dt>
         	<dd>The Power Usage History chart provides power consumption readings for a 24-hour period.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
         <dt><b>Thermal History</b></dt>
         <dd>The Thermal Usage History chart provides temperature readings for a 24-hour period.</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
         <dt><b>Fan History</b></dt>
         <dd>The Fan Usage History chart provides fan usage readings for a 24-hour period.</dd>
